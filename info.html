<h1>Information</h1>

<ul>

<li>➞ FRP is defined as any unrealistic action within a session. This may include FRP speeding, unrealistic roleplays (drug rp's, kidnappings..)</li>

<li>➞ Peacetime is when there is a lack of Emergency Services online and everyone must abide by traffic laws and server rules. Crimes of any sort are strictly prohibited.</li>

<li>➞ The term void is only to be used by staff members or civilians with staff approval. Void is used to nullify an action that is deemed unnecessary to roleplay.</li>

<li>➞ Combat logging the action of leaving a session in an attempt to evade punishment from staff or a ticket from WSP. Combat logging is strictly prohibited and will result in administrative punishments.</li>

<li>➞ Desync is a term that is used when you vehicle becomes out of sync with other vehicles in traffic, and is an automatic void.</li>

<li>➞ When merging lanes, 5+ car distance must be applied. This rule has been set in place to avoid desync and to keep a sense of realism. Failure to follow the 5+ car distance guideline will result in an administrative punishment.</li>

<li>➞ All civilian vehicle colors must be realistic. For example, driving around in a hot pink vehicle is not realistic for a small town like Greenville. If seen with a unrealistic vehicle color, you will receive an administrative punishment.</li>

<li>➞ When joining a JGVRP session, your avatar must be realistic. Unrealistic body parts are not allowed. If seen with an unrealistic avatar, you will receive an administrative punishment. You may only wear a unrealistic avatar if you have the 'Unrealistic Avatar Exemption' role.</li>

<li>➞ Spawns are voided. Session Hosts are not permitted to alter this guideline. Spawn are voided to an certain extent. Any abuse of this guideline which includes but is not limited to; Purposely FRPING, Flinging users, FRP speeds, etc will result in moderation.</li>
